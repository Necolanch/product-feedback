# Product Feedback
This application was inspired by the premium challenge on Frontend Mentor (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-feedback-app-wbvUYqjR6). I simply used the image and attempted to mimic the design and achieve the functionality that is expected of it. Without having their data they provide by paying for a premium membership, I used the JSON Placeholder Posts API (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) to obtain filler post data.

It is a CRUD application built with create-react-app. You would be able to create a post, read that and other posts, update/edit your own post and delete it. Proper form validation is integrated. You can sort the posts using the sort dropdown by most/least likes. Lastly, you can like other posts.
